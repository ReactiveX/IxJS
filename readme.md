# The Interactive Extensions for JavaScript (IxJS)... #

*...is a set of libraries to compose synchronous and asynchronous collections and [Array#extras](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/12/13/ecmascript-5-part-2-array-extras.aspx) style composition in JavaScript*

The Interactive Extensions for JavaScript (IxJS) is a library for creating and composing asynchronous sequences using both the `Iterable` and `AsyncIterable` classes.

## `Iterable`

The `Iterable` class a way to create and compose synchronous collections much like Arrays, Maps and Sets in JavaScript using the Array#extras style using the familiar methods you are used to like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and more.

```js
const Iterator = require('ix').Iterator;

Iterator.from([1,2,3,4])
  .filter(x => x % 2 === 0)
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .forEach(x => console.log(`Next ${x}`));

// => 4
// => 8
```

The `Iterable` class implements the iterator pattern in JavaScript by exposing the `[Symbol.iterator]` method which in turn exposes the `Iterator` class.  The iterator yields values by calling the `next()` method which returns the `IteratorResult` class.

```typescript
interface Iterable<T> {
  [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<T>;
}

interface Iterator<T> {
  [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<T>;
  next(): IteratorResult<T>;
}

interface IteratorResult<T> {
  value: T;
  done: Boolean;
}
```

## `AsyncIterable`

The `AsyncIterator` class is based off the ECMAScript Proposal for [Asynchronous Iterators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration).  This would allow us to create asynchronous collections of Promises and be able to use such methods as the `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and other Array#extras methods that you are used to using.

```js
const AsyncIterableImpl = require('ix').AsyncIterable;

async function *gen() {
  yield Promise.resolve(1);
  yield Promise.resolve(2);
  yield Promise.resolve(3);
  yield Promise.resolve(4);
}

AsyncIterable.from(gen())
  .filter(x => x % 2 === 0)
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .forEachAsync(x => console.log(`Next ${x}`))
  .catch(err => console.log(`Error ${err}`));

// => 4
// => 8
```

The `AsyncIterable` class implements the async iterator pattern in JavaScript by exposing the `[Symbol.asyncIterator]` method which in turn exposes the `AsyncIterator` class.  The iterator yields values by calling the `next()` method which returns a Promise which resolves a `IteratorResult` class.

```typescript
interface AsyncIterable<T> {
  [Symbol.asyncIterator](): AsyncIterator<T>;
}

interface Iterator<T> {
  [Symbol.asyncIterator](): Iterator<T>;
  next(value): Promise<IteratorResult<T>>;
  [optional] throw(value): Promise<IteratorResult<T>>;
  [optional] return(value): Promise<IteratorResult<T>>;
}

interface IteratorResult<T> {
  value: T;
  done: Boolean;
}
```
